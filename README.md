# Reflection
The Discrete Structure assignments taught me the value of double-checking the work before submission. In the first few instances, we missed minute details or just overviewed, which resulted in unnecessary mistakes in Assignment 3, containing Chapter 3.5 to 4.2. As there was no chance to resubmit, I was fully aware that all tasks are to be performed at the same level and accuracy as others. These assignments helped me learn more about very important topics, such as permutations, combinations, and probability, while enhancing my logical reasoning and the ability to analyze information. In my opinion, this course can be improved by including more challenging problems. While most tasks were either simple or moderately complex, adding more complicated questions would make us think more deeply and help us to solve problems more efficiently.
